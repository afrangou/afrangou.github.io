I am a medical writer and strategist at [Open Health](https://www.openhealthgroup.com). I write publications and medical affairs materials for pharma and biotech, and build strategic communication plans to maximise their impact. 

I specialise in oncology, particularly cancer genomics, and have worked with AbbVie, Astellas, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genmab, and Merck, among others.

Previously, I spent 3.5 years (2017-2021) at the [Big Data Institute, University of Oxford](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/anna-frangou) as a postdoctoral bioinformatician in cancer genomics, working with [Prof David Wedge](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/david.wedge.html), [Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald](https://www.oncology.cam.ac.uk/directory/r-fitzgerald), and [Prof Ian Tomlinson](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cancer-centre/research/tomlinson-group). 

Focuses included [developing methodology for somatic copy number calling](https://github.com/afrangou/CleanCNA), [characterising the mutational landscape of colorectal](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.16.515599v1) and testicular cancer in collaboration with [Genomics England](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk), and [inferring tumour evolution and heterogeneity in Barrett’s oesophagus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28237-4). For code, see [my GitHub](https://github.com/afrangou). 

I also obtained two independent research grants from the [Human Immune Discovery Initiative fund](https://www.immunology.ox.ac.uk/human-immune-discovery-initiative/hidi-internal-fund), and Cancer Research UK, to combine the genomics and immunopeptidomics of colorectal cancer.

[My DPhil (PhD)](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ca235cb7-4d90-41d6-ad3d-0883567783a1) is from the [Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/). I worked with [Prof Simon Myers](https://myersgroup.github.io/index.html) and [Prof Gil McVean](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/team/professor-gil-mcvean) to infer and date admixture between modern humans and Neandertals through genealogy construction in recombinationally cold genomic regions. 

I have also published several times with [Prof Robin Dunbar](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/robin-dunbar) – of Dunbar number fame – as well as coauthoring a [feature article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286264410_Wildlife_in_a_warming_world) with [Prof Rob Whittaker](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/rwhittaker.html) in the UNESCO publication ‘A World of Science’.
