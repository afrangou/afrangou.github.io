# Dr Anna Frangou

I am a medical writer and strategist at Open Health. I write publications and medical affairs materials for pharma and biotech, and build strategic communication plans to maximise their impact. 

I specialise in oncology, particularly cancer genomics, and have worked with AbbVie, Astellas, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genmab, and Merck, among others.

Previously, I spent 3.5 years (2017-2021) at the Big Data Institute, University of Oxford as a postdoctoral bioinformatician in cancer genomics, working with Prof David Wedge, Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald, and Prof Ian Tomlinson. 

Focuses included developing methodology for somatic copy number calling, characterising the mutational landscape of colorectal and testicular cancer in collaboration with Genomics England, and inferring tumour evolution and heterogeneity in Barrett’s oesophagus. My GitHub is here. 

I also obtained two independent research grants from the Human Immune Discovery Initiative fund, and Cancer Research UK, to combine the genomics and immunopeptidomics of colorectal cancer.

My DPhil (PhD) is from the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford. I worked with Prof Simon Myers and Prof Gil McVean to infer and date admixture between modern humans and Neandertals through genealogy construction in recombinationally cold genomic regions. 

I have also published several times with Prof Robin Dunbar – of Dunbar number fame – as well as coauthoring a feature article with Prof Rob Whittaker in the UNESCO publication ‘A World of Science’.
